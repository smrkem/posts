Anothure look at failure of Group Identity on the political left ... yet again - one more time.

todo:  
- fairness belongs to both groups. maybe 'equality'?
- evidence of failure to reason fairly on the left

> We on the newleft (or _downleft_ - see related article) beleive in progress and evidence-based thinking, reasoning and approaches.

The old left _used_ to believe in evidence-based thinking. Rather, the old left used to believe in two things __equality__ and __progress__<sub>(1)</sub>, at a time when there was near perfect overlap between these two motivating principles.

Western society has seen a huge increase in levels of fairness over a pretty short period of time (20 years). As we progressed, we also developed a more nuanced and informed view of __equality__. 

We found that 'equality of opportunity' and 'equality of outcome' were useful ways to break things down.  There is widespread agreement that opportunity should be fairly distributed, but 'equality of outcome' is turning out to be problematic. 

> We on the newleft, beleive that reasonable people can move towards ideal solutions, especially when they make sure their decisions are guided by evidence, open investigation and open debate.


We need discussion on equality of outcome. Some amount of inequality will exist due to natural (in some cases desirable) factors. Some other amount of outcome inequality<sub>(2)</sub> will exist due to privileged classes having a 'head-start' for so many generations.  

And the left has fractured. People who are motivated by __fairness__ are not necessarily also motivated by __progress__, and vice-versa. 


"Things have gotten a whole lot better, but it's still not perfect equality, so we should keep applying pressure where we can." They consider where we're currently at and where we want to get to.

People who can think in terms of acceleration realize that what's important is how quickly you're moving and when to ease up on the gas pedal. 



- Lets try out new things and see what happens. Gotta be smart about the risks.

***
<sup>(1)</sup>  I use labels like __fairness__ and __progress__ throughout. These are mainly just labels for what I see as 2 different groups that has composed the traditional left. The groups are _different_, but not _distinct_ - ie: there is overlap between groups.  

I chose __fairness__ and __progress__ because I think they do a pretty good job of describing people's motivations and intentions. Concepts of fairness and progress are important - but that's not why I bold them. They're named and bolded only to make it easier to identify the 2 different populations I'm referring to. 

<sup>(2)</sup> 'outcome inequality' needs a new name. It sounds too much like 'income ineqaulity', which already has too many negative connotations. People can't think reasonably about it anymore.

It's a tainted pattern of neurons that little good will come out of activating. Seriously - brains work like that. It's why you can tell which way news article publishers lean based on what pictures (flattering or unflattering) of people they show in their stores.
