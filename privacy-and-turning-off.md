Appears to me that the trend of turning off and absenting yourself from social media channels is growing. Same with the concern for privacy.

I think these are all valid concerns - and some are _critical_ concerns when it comes to figuring out new and better systems for living our lives.

What about tying each person to a 'user' so each person has _some kind_ of online profile? Should that be considered a violation of privacy extreme enough so that it outweighs the potential utility of being able to identify each person digitally?

My opinion is that for technologies with high utility, any system that doesn't take advantage of them will be outcompeted by systems that do. 

Ideally, we keep all the advantages of the technology while mitigating away all the risk.

The risk seems to fall into two different kinds of buckets.

There's the bucket where we don't want to give government and companies the power to use this kind of technology against us - and what is meant by 'against us' is itself a rich area for discussion.
