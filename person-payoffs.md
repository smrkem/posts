Do I place a larger value on improving existing conditions when determining my payoffs?

I'm having a discussion with my wife.

An idea comes up that I think is important and worth talking about that she does not.

So we need to look into that idea of 'worth talking about'.

My view:
talking about things helps build 'models', and an understanding of how to make things better.

My view of existing conditions is so bleak that I'm willing to expend large amounts of energy into fixing them.

My wife's view of existing conditions is less bleak - and the amount of energy she feels is worth investing is lower.
