# Oh shit ...

I just realized that my current thinking is heading in a weird, and possibly really bad direction. I'm honestly starting to wonder if it would be all that bad if all of us were governed by an AI.

Facts:
- AI turns out to perform better than humans at all sorts of tasks like piloting vehicles, surgeries, etc.
- Government is, more and more, concerned hugely with what are essentially math problems. Taxes, budgets, spending and economy all involve problems that lend themselves well to machine learning. Same for voting systems and game-theoretic decision making.

Shit. 

In the current state of AI, these algorithms have no understanding, or even the concept, of _trade_, _laws_ or _people_. Its just crunching numbers.

We're so far away from anything that might 'decide' to take over. Any question of AI being hostile to humanity due to its own self-interest is nonsense right now. It literally doesn't make sense to ask the question until we know more about what such a system would look like.
