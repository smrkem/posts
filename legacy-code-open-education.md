Industrial revolution - we did a decent job of adapting

Information revolution - we haven't yet adapted.

Two choices:
A) Adapt existing systems
B) Ground up systems redesign

Ground up system redesigns are really hard to picture. They're also scary as hell. There are some major questions (like "what would transationing look like"), any one of which would probably be fatal to the attempt if suitable answers cannot be found. For many people this is a non-starter.

Adapting our existing educational, health-care and political systems probably means adding 'special code' to interface with all the 'legacy code'. 
We'll acquire 'technical debt'. We've _been_ acquiring technical debt. There are loopholes which are being exploited.

I think we need new systems and the gains from adapting our current ones are far outweighed by the costs. I believe that the more backwards-compatibility we insist on - the less we'll be prepared to face the challenges ahead.

Ideally we want to prototype the fuck out of everything in zero or low-risk *sandbox environments*. The private sector gets to do this - especially as value shifts more towards digital / information resources - and they've gotten really good at it.

What's happening right now in education is a fantastic examle. The idea of open education shows up around ~2005 I think - maybe from MIT or UCBerkely originally - and it starts catching on, pretty slowly at first. 

And then you see tech startups getting involved and things start to take off.

Traditional educational institutions have been slow to adapt (other than some early adopters) - but it definitely seems as though they've all finally come to realize that they won't survive otherwise. 

It's an amazing step. A person will have more choice and freedom in directing and fulfilling the needs of their own education. I'm confident we'll be able to solve the problem of effectively providing good guidance.

But here it's worth looking at the entities emerging and their incentives. I've seen variations of business models - but they all fall into 2 buckets:
- Some amount of premium content is pay-only
- Content is free, but certification is pay-only

The course providers want to be the ones that businesses trust when they are hiring. They want to be the ones users go to for the best educational content.
They are incentivized to control content.

I ask myself "Where do we want to be with this?". I like the idea that specific courses and instructors might emerge as the _de facto_ standard, but with others competing for the spot. I _love_ the idea that if the content is free to translate and redistribute, then internet access becomes the only barrier to accessing the best educational content.



Could a non-profit entity, operating and evolving throush some fully open and democratized process - compete in this new educational space? What does content creation look like? If 



- an apparatus for group decision-making
- an apparatus for implementing / enforcing decisions

I can't think of any reason why these 2 appratus need to be identical, and I can think of a few reasons why they should be independant
