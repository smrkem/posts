# 1. Introduction: five first lessons

[0:30s] looked for handouts online for Game 1 and Game 2. There are resources available for download on the course [homepage](https://oyc.yale.edu/economics/econ-159), but have yet to find these specifically.

There are 2 textbooks. 

Main: Dutter - Strategy and Games
more rigorous: J Watson - Strategies
reccommended: thinking strategically

Just there as backup. Not required.

### What is game theory?

&#0946;


[0:58s] A method of studying strategic situations.

Strategic situations do not include perfect monopolies where there is no competition, or perfect competition where actors are price takers and don't need to worry about the actions of others.

All 'imperfect' competition is strategic.

```A setting where outcomes that affect you depend on actions by you and by others```
