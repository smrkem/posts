# Where to go next

Ref: Rubin Report, Jordan P and Bret W ? End of show comments.

### Next Step:
> Do some organizational work. The next step is opening up the question of '_Where to go next_' to public discussion.
---  

In general, we'd want to:
- Get more people motivated and grow the audience 
- Get motivated people more involved

There is building momentum - but I think maybe some level of frustration.

We need to add in some drama to the discussion.

Where does Bret W describe Game Theory in relation to politics / Game B ?

Make a fun infographic or diagram of this public conversation. 

Key players:
- Sam Harris
- Christopher Hitchens
- Richard Dawkins
- Joe Rogan
- Jordan Peterson
- Bret and Eric Weinstein
- Dave Rubin

Track 'appearances'.
- participants
- date/time
- link (authoritative)
- metadata: show/event/source/links
- discussion points

Some people are 'facilitators' - like Dave Rubin and Joe Rogan.

### Context:

A lively, and I think important coversation has erupted lately. There are some main participlants and some key themes, questions and points of view are emerging.


One of these themes I've been seeing recently is the question of 'Where to go next?'.

In general, there seems to be widespread agreement about the importance of:
- free and open information and public debate

I believe there is huge value in spending energy investigating methods of facilitating and democratizing public conversation and debate. 

How do we start learning as much as possible about communicating and decision making in a global context? What does that actually look like?

One of my takeaways from this conversation is:  
> ### We gotta start protyting the fuck out of everything. Too much of the conversation currently involves incredibly well thought-out, but ultimately uninformed, speculation.  In order to be evidenced-based thinkers we need some frigging evidence. 
> ### Let's start trying out a bunch of things and collecting data.

Let's have tons of initial, clumsy failures and get those out of the way early. Even very stupid efforts, if well-intentioned, can provide invaluable information. 

We need to learn about how the information currently flows, and how it should. We need to learn about people's level of involvement, their interest, their ability and desire to participate.

I think Bret W has said and put forth some great things in terms of:
- the idea of prototyping in general
- the characteristics of current systems, and what desirable alternatives might look like.

> People interested in prototyping a public discussion and decision-making system.

This definitely sounds like some sort of social networking app. Can we leverage existing solutions like twitter, slack, facebook, exchange overflow, quora, etc?

Bret W also has some things about the existing 'Game A' systems and the need for new 'Game B' systems. Game B systems should operate with better incentives than their Game A counterparts - something to keep in mind.

I'd think that a good feature of Game B systems would be democratized control and ownership over such systems, if that's even possible. Again, lets try a bunch of different shit and learn about what works and what doesn't and why.

I have a few thoughts along the lines of branch - fork - pull request models, which I try to detail in my Prototyping Prototyping post.
