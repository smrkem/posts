## The Story So Far (past ~200 years)

We elect and pay people to handle Decision Making and Implementation. These peple are responsible for representing the needs and desires of the group that elected them. Elections are held regularly within each country, using that country's traditional voting and representational strategy.

Government is made up of these elected officials, and different branches of government are set up to deal with policy making and enforcement. Resource production and trade is largely handled by the 'free' market - with the government acting to facilitate and sometimes regulate.

There are some obvious successes - with this system in place we've seen amazing success and progress. The middle class is richer than kings and queens were just a few generations ago. Science and technology has thrived and we've advanced our knowledge in most subjects - some exponentially.

There are some obvious failures:
- there is evidence of systematic bias towards (or against) specific populations of people (gender, race, etc.)
- there is evidence of corruption of the free market system, and an unfair consolidation of wealth



## What needs to happen next ?

Everything decent we know about how communities and populations interact and behave we've learned in the past 100 years - arguably only the past 20 years. Same goes for the psychology of individuals and groups. And how systems (including biases) emerge and evolve over time. 

We're still largely dependant on systems (political, educational, etc.) that were developed way before that.


The really big questions all seem to reduce to something like: 

> "Who should get to determine the current state of the system - and who should determine its future?"

and

> "How do we safely make changes to these systems, without risk of losing benefits the existing system provides?"


If your answer to the first is something like "Everybody should" - . We need to democratize the fuck out of everything.
- Education
- Decision Making
- Research, Discussion and Information Flow

The solution (or a step towards one) to the second seems equally

At the very least we at least need to start organizing and tracking this shit
