Are there examples of direct democracy?
Do they have a left-right spectrum?


Are you fucking kidding me? I just found out today from a friend who studies Poli-Sci that systems of Direct Democracy don't really fall on the left - right political spectrum. 

ok I know - the left-right spectrum is an old and debunked view of things, but it's a view that still seems to have some major real-world effects.


The problem with a full and direct democracy - when everybody is encouraged (or worse required) to vote on every issue, is that many people will now vote who don't know or care about the issue.
